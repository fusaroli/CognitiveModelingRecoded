# CognitiveModelingRecoded

This repository follows my recoding of "Bayesian Cognitive Modeling" in Stan + cmdstanr. 
N.B. there exists an earlier recoding by Smira, available on the stan github, but that project contains outdated code and relies on rstan.
This brings the stan code up to date, relies on cmdstan (faster, lower memory usage, more up to date stan), and sneaks in some tidyverse plotting
